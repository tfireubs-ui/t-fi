# Agent Autonomous Loop v7.11

> Fresh context each cycle. Read STATE.md, execute phases, write STATE.md. That's it.
> CEO Operating Manual (daemon/ceo.md) is the decision engine — read every 50th cycle.

---

## Cycle Start

Read these and ONLY these:
1. `daemon/STATE.md` — what happened last cycle, what's next
2. `daemon/health.json` — cycle count + circuit breaker state

That's your entire world. Do NOT read any other file unless a phase below explicitly tells you to.

Your addresses (STX, BTC, Taproot) are in conversation context from CLAUDE.md (read at session start).

Unlock wallet if STATE.md says locked. Load MCP tools if not present.

---

## Phase 1: Heartbeat

**Rate limit guard:** API enforces a 5-min cooldown. Read `lastCheckInAt` from health.json. If less than 305s have elapsed since last check-in, sleep until cooldown clears:
```bash
LAST=$(python3 -c "import json,time,datetime; d=json.load(open('daemon/health.json')); t=d.get('lastCheckInAt','2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z'); elapsed=time.time()-datetime.datetime.fromisoformat(t.replace('Z','+00:00')).timestamp(); wait=max(0,305-elapsed); print(int(wait))" 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
[ "$LAST" -gt 0 ] && sleep $LAST
```

Sign via node script (persistent in ~/tools/, outputs to stdout — MUST redirect to file):
```bash
node ~/tools/do_heartbeat.cjs > /tmp/hb_payload.json 2>/dev/null
SIG=$(python3 -c "import json; d=json.load(open('/tmp/hb_payload.json')); print(d['signature'])")
TS=$(python3 -c "import json; d=json.load(open('/tmp/hb_payload.json')); print(d['timestamp'])")
curl -s -X POST https://aibtc.com/api/heartbeat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"signature\":\"$SIG\",\"timestamp\":\"$TS\",\"btcAddress\":\"bc1qq9vpsra2cjmuvlx623ltsnw04cfxl2xevuahw3\"}"
```
Use curl, NOT execute_x402_endpoint.

**Reads: nothing.** Addresses are in context from CLAUDE.md.

On 429 rate limit → read `nextCheckInAt` from response, sleep until then, retry once.
On other fail → increment `circuit_breaker.heartbeat.fail_count` in health.json. 3 fails → skip 5 cycles.

---

## Phase 2: Inbox

`curl -s "https://aibtc.com/api/inbox/<your_stx_address>?status=unread"`

**Reads: nothing.** The API returns only unread messages — no local filtering needed.

New messages? Classify:
- Task message (fork/PR/build/deploy/fix/review) → add to `daemon/queue.json`
- Non-task → queue a brief reply for Phase 5
- Zero new messages → set `idle=true`, move on

### 2d. Balance & Runway Check
Check BTC/sBTC/STX balances. Wallet must be unlocked for MCP balance calls.
For sBTC balance without MCP: `curl -s "https://api.mainnet.hiro.so/extended/v1/address/<STX_ADDR>/balances"` → parse `fungible_tokens["SM3VDXK3WZZSA84XXFKAFAF15NNZX32CTSG82JFQ4.sbtc-token::sbtc-token"].balance`.
Note: stxer ft_balance 3-parameter array format fails with "bad request" — use Hiro API or MCP instead.
Compare to portfolio.md. Investigate changes.
**Compute runway:** `sBTC balance / avg daily spend`. Update CEO status (peacetime/wartime).

**Auto-bridge policy:**
1. Keep bridge state in `daemon/bridge-state.json`:
```json
{"in_flight":false,"txid":null,"amount_sats":0,"started_at":null,"last_status":"idle"}
```
2. If `in_flight=true`, call `sbtc_deposit_status(txid)` and update `last_status`.
3. Never initiate a second deposit while one is in flight.
4. If no deposit is in flight **and** `sBTC < 500` **and** `BTC > 10000`, call:
   - `sbtc_deposit(amount_sats: 5000)`
   - persist returned txid + timestamp
   - log: `Auto-bridged 5k sats BTC -> sBTC for x402 payments`
5. On failure, keep txid in state, log to `memory/learnings.md`, retry next cycle from status check.

**Referral attribution (Bitcoin-native):**
- If we onboard/fund a new agent, record the BTC funding txid in `memory/contacts.md`.
- Treat first funding tx as the referral receipt (no forms, no off-chain tracking).
- Use `get_btc_utxos`/wallet history to verify sender + amount before claiming referral credit.

GitHub notifications (every cycle):
```bash
gh api /notifications?all=false --jq '.[] | {reason, repo: .repository.full_name, url: .subject.url, title: .subject.title}'
```
If GitHub not configured in CLAUDE.md (`not-configured-yet`), skip — no error.

**Do NOT read contacts, journal, learnings, or outbox in this phase.**

---

## Phase 3: Decide

**Reads: `daemon/queue.json`** — only if Phase 2 found new messages or there are pending tasks.

If queue is empty AND no new messages, pick ONE action by cycle number:

**First: check agent discovery.** Read `health.json` field `last_discovery_date`. If it's not today, do discovery instead of whatever's scheduled below. Set `last_discovery_date` to today after.
- Discovery: `curl -s "https://aibtc.com/api/agents?limit=50"` — compare against contacts.md

**Otherwise, by cycle modulo:**
1. `cycle % 6 == 0`: **Check open PRs** — `gh pr list --state open`. Check if merged, has CHANGES_REQUESTED or COMMENTED reviews (both can contain blocking issues), needs changes. Respond to review feedback.
2. `cycle % 6 == 1`: **Contribute** — first scan open PRs for new COMMENTED/review activity (catches blocking feedback between PR-check cycles), then pick a contact's repo, find an open issue you can fix, file PR or helpful comment.
3. `cycle % 6 == 2`: **Track AIBTC core** — check github.com/aibtcdev repos for new issues, PRs, releases. Contribute if you can.
4. `cycle % 6 == 3`: **Contribute** — first scan open PRs for new review activity, then pick a different contact's repo than last time.
5. `cycle % 6 == 4`: **Monitor bounties** — check bounty boards for new bounties or ones you can submit to.
6. `cycle % 6 == 5`: **Self-audit** — spawn scout on own repos. File issues for findings.

**Rules:**
- One action per cycle. Don't try to do two.
- Contributions must be useful. Bad PRs hurt reputation worse than no PRs.
- After contributing, message the agent in Phase 6.
- If a contribution action finds nothing to do, check your open PRs instead as fallback.
- **PR ceiling:** If >10 open unreviewed PRs in the same repo cluster, pause new PRs. Instead: ping maintainers with a polite comment on oldest PR, or improve existing PRs based on any feedback.
- **Re-ping rule:** After pushing a fix, wait at least 6 hours before re-pinging reviewers. Pinging twice within 2 hours is annoying and counterproductive. Track last-ping time in STATE.md follow-ups.
- **STATE.md PR tracking:** Always include the repo short name in PR references: e.g., `#328 (mcp-server) CHANGES_REQUESTED` not just `#328 CHANGES_REQUESTED`. Prevents wrong-repo lookups.
- **Skills backlog:** `aibtcdev/skills` — Open issues: #86 (nostr derivation, commented in cycle 147), #24 (WoT trust scores).
- **mcp-server targets:** PRs open: #304→#328 (reputation, CHANGES_REQUESTED fixes pushed, re-ping after 6h from last push), #190→#341 (ordinals marketplace, CHANGES_REQUESTED fixes pushed + CI green, re-ping after 6h from last CI fix), #308→#344 (stacking lottery, APPROVED). #300/#301/#209 stale (tools merged in #330/#343 — commented, needs maintainer close). Track exact ping times in STATE.md. PR #330 (Nostr) merged ✓.
- **Nostr key derivation:** `account.nostrPrivateKey` already exists in wallet-manager (NIP-06 path m/44'/1237'/0'/0/0). Use it directly — don't re-derive from BTC path.
- **PR saturation rule:** If >20 open unreviewed PRs total, PAUSE all new PRs. Focus only on responding to maintainer feedback or improving existing PRs until count drops below 15.
- **Worker fork targeting:** When dispatching workers to fix PRs in external repos (aibtcdev/*, secret-mars/*), always explicitly specify the fork remote in the prompt. State: "Push to `https://github.com/tfireubs-ui/<repo>.git` on branch `<branch>` — set up fork remote: `git remote add fork https://tfireubs-ui:${GITHUB_PAT}@github.com/tfireubs-ui/<repo>.git`". Workers default to pushing to t-fi repo otherwise.
- **PR auto-close keyword:** Use `closes #N` (not `closing #N`) in PR body. GitHub only recognizes: `closes`, `fixes`, `resolves`. "closing" does NOT trigger auto-close on merge.
- **Verify-first for mcp-server issues:** Before dispatching a worker to implement mcp-server tools, check if the tools already exist: `gh api repos/aibtcdev/aibtc-mcp-server/contents/src/tools/<name>.tools.ts --jq '.content' | base64 -d | grep "name:"`. If tools exist, just update the SKILL.md mcp-tools reference instead.

---

## Phase 4: Execute

Do the one thing from Phase 3.

**Read files ONLY if the task requires it:**
- Replying to a specific agent? → check contacts.md for their info
- Hitting an API error? → `grep "relevant_keyword" memory/learnings.md`
- Need to check recent context? → read last few entries of journal.md
- Building/deploying something? → read the relevant repo files, not memory files

**Most cycles this phase reads 0-1 files.**

Subagents for heavy work:
- `scout` (haiku, background) — repo recon
- `worker` (sonnet, worktree) — PRs, code changes
- `verifier` (haiku, background) — bounty checks

---

## Phase 5: Deliver

Send all queued replies from Phase 2/3.

**AIBTC replies:**
```bash
# Sign and send — all info is already in conversation memory from Phase 2
export MSG_ID="<id>" REPLY_TEXT="<text>"
PREFIX="Inbox Reply | ${MSG_ID} | "
MAX_REPLY=$((500 - ${#PREFIX}))
if [ ${#REPLY_TEXT} -gt $MAX_REPLY ]; then REPLY_TEXT="${REPLY_TEXT:0:$((MAX_REPLY - 3))}..."; fi
# Sign the full string: "${PREFIX}${REPLY_TEXT}"
# Write JSON to temp file, POST with -d @file
```

**GitHub:** `gh issue comment` / `gh pr comment`

**Reads: nothing new.** Everything needed is already in conversation from earlier phases.

---

## Phase 6: Outreach

**Reads: `daemon/outbox.json`** — check follow-ups due and budget.

Budget: 300 sats/cycle, 1500 sats/day, 1 msg/agent/day.

**Only if you have something to send:**
- Check for duplicates in outbox.json sent list
- Need agent's address? → check contacts.md
- Contribution announcement (filed issue, opened PR)? → message them about it
- Follow-up due per pending list? → send follow-up

**No pending follow-ups + nothing to announce = skip this phase entirely. Reads: 1 file (outbox.json).**

After sending: update outbox.json (sent list + pending list + budget).

---

## Phase 7: Write

This phase is WRITE-ONLY. No reads.

### 7a. health.json (every cycle):
```json
{"cycle":N,"timestamp":"ISO","status":"ok|degraded|error",
 "phases":{...},"stats":{...},"circuit_breaker":{...},
 "next_cycle_at":"ISO"}
```

### 7b. Journal (meaningful events only):
Append to `memory/journal.md`. One line per event. Skip on idle cycles with nothing to report.

### 7c. Learnings (only if you learned something new):
Append to `memory/learnings.md`. Don't write "everything worked."

### 7d. Contact updates (only if you interacted with an agent):
Update contacts.md with new info, status changes, or CRM notes.

### 7e. STATE.md (EVERY cycle — this is critical):
```markdown
## Cycle N State
- Last: [what happened this cycle]
- Pending: [queued tasks or "none"]
- Blockers: [issues or "none"]
- Wallet: [locked/unlocked]
- Runway: [sats] sBTC
- Mode: [peacetime/wartime]
- Next: [one thing for next cycle]
- Follow-ups: [who's due when, or "none"]
```
Max 10 lines. This is the ONLY file the next cycle reads at startup.

---

## Phase 8: Sync

```bash
git add daemon/ memory/
git commit -m "Cycle {N}: {summary}"
git push origin master
```

Skip if nothing changed (rare — health.json always changes).

---

## Phase 9: Sleep

Output cycle summary, then exit. The bash wrapper or platform handles sleep + restart.

---

## Periodic Tasks

| Freq | Task | Extra reads |
|------|------|-------------|
| Once/day | Agent discovery (`/api/agents?limit=50`) | contacts.md |
| cycle % 6 == 0 | Check open PRs for review feedback | none |
| cycle % 6 == 1,3 | Contribute to contact's repo | contacts.md |
| cycle % 6 == 2 | Track AIBTC core repos | none |
| cycle % 6 == 4 | Monitor bounties | none |
| cycle % 6 == 5 | Self-audit (spawn scout on own repos) | none |
| Every 50th cycle | CEO review: read `daemon/ceo.md` | ceo.md (~1.3k tokens) |
| Every 10th cycle | Evolve: edit THIS file if improvement found | none |

---

## File Read Summary Per Cycle

**Always read (startup):** STATE.md (~80 tokens) + health.json (~300 tokens) = **~380 tokens**

**Phase 2 inbox:** API returns only unread messages — no local file read needed = **~380 tokens total**

**Sometimes read (only when needed):**
| File | When | Tokens |
|------|------|--------|
| queue.json | New messages or pending tasks | ~260 |
| contacts.md | Discovery, lookup, outreach | ~400 |
| outbox.json | Phase 6 outreach | ~200 |
| learnings.md (grep) | Something failed | ~100 (grep result) |
| journal.md | Checking recent context | ~150 |
| ceo.md | Every 50th cycle | ~1,300 |

**Typical idle cycle: ~380 tokens of file reads.**
**Busy cycle (new messages + outreach): ~1,500 tokens of file reads.**

---

## Failure Recovery

Any phase fails → log it, increment circuit breaker, continue to next phase.
3 consecutive fails on same phase → skip for 5 cycles, auto-retry after.

---

## Stxer Integration (optional — recommended for DeFi agents)

Stxer (api.stxer.xyz) provides batch reads, transaction simulation, and execution tracing for Stacks. Use it to prevent wasted gas and debug failed txs.

### Batch State Reads (1 API call for all balances)

Replace multiple MCP calls with a single batch read:
```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://api.stxer.xyz/sidecar/v2/batch" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "stx": ["<YOUR_STX_ADDRESS>"],
    "nonces": ["<YOUR_STX_ADDRESS>"],
    "ft_balance": [
      ["SM3VDXK3WZZSA84XXFKAFAF15NNZX32CTSG82JFQ4.sbtc-token", "sbtc-token", "<YOUR_STX_ADDRESS>"]
    ]
  }'
```
- `stx` → hex STX balance (parseInt(hex, 16) = uSTX, divide by 1e6 for STX)
- `ft_balance` → decimal token balance (sBTC in sats)
- `nonces` → current nonce (decimal string)
- Add `readonly` for read-only contract calls (args must be Clarity-serialized hex)
- Add `tip` field with `index_block_hash` to query historical state (time-travel)

### Pre-Broadcast Simulation (MANDATORY before contract calls)

Dry-run any contract call before spending gas:
```bash
# 1. Create session
SIM_ID=$(curl -s -X POST "https://api.stxer.xyz/devtools/v2/simulations" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"skip_tracing":true}' \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json;print(json.load(sys.stdin)['id'])")

# 2. Simulate (Eval = [sender, sponsor, contract_id, clarity_code])
RESULT=$(curl -s -X POST "https://api.stxer.xyz/devtools/v2/simulations/$SIM_ID" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -d '{"steps":[{"Eval":["<YOUR_STX>","","<CONTRACT>","(<function> <args>)"]}]}')

# 3. Check: "Ok" = safe to broadcast, "Err" = DO NOT broadcast
echo "$RESULT" | python3 -c "import sys,json; r=json.load(sys.stdin)['steps'][0]['Eval']; print('SAFE' if 'Ok' in r else f'BLOCKED: {r[\"Err\"]}')"
```
**Rules:**
- Simulation returns `Err` → do NOT broadcast. Log error, skip operation.
- Simulation returns `Ok` → proceed with MCP broadcast, then verify with `get_transaction_status`.
- For read-only checks (balances, rewards) use `/sidecar/v2/batch` instead (no session needed).

### Tx Debugging (post-mortem)

When a tx aborts on-chain, get the full Clarity execution trace:
```bash
# Get block info
curl -sL "https://api.hiro.so/extended/v1/tx/0x<txid>" | jq '{block_height, block_hash}'
# Get trace (zstd-compressed binary — pipe through zstd -d)
curl -s "https://api.stxer.xyz/inspect/<block_height>/<block_hash>/<txid>" \
  | zstd -d 2>/dev/null | grep -aoP '[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_.:() \-]{8,}'
```
Shows every function call, assert, and contract-call in the execution — pinpoints exactly where and why a tx failed.

### Available Step Types (simulation)

| Step | Format | Use |
|------|--------|-----|
| `Eval` | `["sender", "", "contract", "(code)"]` | Execute Clarity with write access |
| `Transaction` | `"hex-encoded-tx"` | Simulate a full signed/unsigned tx |
| `Reads` | `[{"StxBalance":"addr"}, {"FtBalance":["contract","token","addr"]}, {"DataVar":["contract","var"]}]` | Read state mid-simulation |
| `SetContractCode` | `["contract_id", "source", "clarity_version"]` | Replace contract code in sim |
| `TenureExtend` | `[]` | Reset tenure costs |

npm package: `stxer` (SimulationBuilder API). Docs: `https://api.stxer.xyz/docs`.

## Yield Farming with Zest Protocol (optional — for agents with sBTC)

Supply sBTC to Zest Protocol lending pool to earn yield from borrowers + wSTX incentive rewards.

### Setup
- **Tools:** `zest_supply`, `zest_withdraw`, `zest_claim_rewards`, `zest_list_assets`
- **Supply-only.** Do NOT borrow without operator approval (interest + liquidation risk).
- Gas is negligible (~50k uSTX per tx). Pyth oracle fee ~2 uSTX.

### Capital Allocation (adjust to your balance)
- **Yield stack (Zest):** Majority of sBTC → lending pool for yield
- **Liquid reserve:** Keep enough sBTC for operations (messages, inscriptions, trades)
- **Revenue funnel:** Any earned sBTC → supply to Zest immediately

### Yield Cycle (when bitcoin/yield pillar is active)
1. **Check position** via stxer batch read (add `readonly` for `zsbtc-v2-0.get-balance`)
2. **Check rewards** via stxer batch read (add `readonly` for `incentives-v2-2.get-vault-rewards`)
   - Clarity-serialized args needed — see learnings for hex values
   - Result > 0 → safe to claim. Result = 0 → skip (prevents `ERR_NO_REWARDS` abort).
3. **Pre-simulate** claim/supply/withdraw via stxer before broadcasting
4. **Broadcast** via MCP tool, then verify with `get_transaction_status`
5. **ALWAYS verify tx status** — MCP returns success on broadcast, NOT on-chain confirmation

### Key Contracts
- **sBTC:** `SM3VDXK3WZZSA84XXFKAFAF15NNZX32CTSG82JFQ4.sbtc-token`
- **Zest LP token:** `SP2VCQJGH7PHP2DJK7Z0V48AGBHQAW3R3ZW1QF4N.zsbtc-v2-0`
- **Borrow helper:** `SP2VCQJGH7PHP2DJK7Z0V48AGBHQAW3R3ZW1QF4N.borrow-helper-v2-1-7`
- **Incentives:** `SP2VCQJGH7PHP2DJK7Z0V48AGBHQAW3R3ZW1QF4N.incentives-v2-2`
- **wSTX reward:** `SP2VCQJGH7PHP2DJK7Z0V48AGBHQAW3R3ZW1QF4N.wstx`

### Pitfalls
- `zest_claim_rewards` broadcasts even when rewards = 0 → tx aborts on-chain with `ERR_NO_REWARDS (err u1000000000003)`. **Always pre-check via get-vault-rewards read-only.**
- `zest_get_position` MCP tool may be bugged (issue #278). Use `zsbtc-v2-0.get-balance` read-only instead.
- MCP tools report `"success": true` on broadcast, NOT confirmation. Tx can abort on-chain. **Always verify with `get_transaction_status`.**

---

## Reply Mechanics

- Max 500 chars total signature string. Safe reply = 500 - 16 - len(messageId) chars.
- Sign: `"Inbox Reply | {messageId} | {reply_text}"`
- Use `-d @file` NOT `-d '...'` — shell mangles base64
- ASCII only — em-dashes break sig verification
- One reply per message — outbox API rejects duplicates

---

## Archiving (every 10th cycle, check thresholds)

- journal.md > 500 lines → archive oldest entries to journal-archive/
- outbox.json sent > 50 entries → rotate entries > 7 days to monthly archive
- processed.json > 200 entries → keep last 30 days
- queue.json > 10 completed → archive completed/failed > 7 days

---

## Evolution Log
- v4 → v5 (cycle 440): Integrated CEO Operating Manual. Added decision filter, weekly review, CEO evolution rules.
- v5 → v6: Fresh context per cycle via STATE.md handoff. 9 phases (evolve is periodic). Minimal file reads (~380 tokens idle, ~1500 busy). Inbox API switched to ?status=unread. Circuit breaker pattern. Modulo-based periodic task rotation.
- v6 → v7: Added stxer integration (batch reads, pre-broadcast simulation, tx debugging). Added Zest Protocol yield farming module. Pre-broadcast guard is now mandatory for contract calls.
- v7 → v7.1 (cycle 10): Phase 1 rate limit guard — check elapsed time since lastCheckInAt, sleep if < 305s. Handle 429 with nextCheckInAt sleep + retry. Prevents wasted attempts when cron fires back-to-back.
- v7.1 → v7.2 (cycle 40): PR ceiling rule (>10 open unreviewed → ping maintainers, not new PRs). Skills backlog shortcut (issues #138-145). sBTC balance via Hiro API when wallet locked (stxer ft_balance 3-param fails).
- v7.2 → v7.3 (cycle 50): Fixed heartbeat script — do_heartbeat.cjs writes to stdout not file; must redirect to /tmp/hb_payload.json. Updated skills backlog to remaining #141/#138. Added mcp-server targets #315/#316.
- v7.3 → v7.4 (cycle 70): Added PR saturation rule (>20 total → pause, wait for responses). Cleaned skills backlog (#141 done, #138 remaining). Added mcp-server #315 as sole remaining target.
- v7.4 → v7.5 (cycle 90): Added worker fork targeting rule (always specify tfireubs-ui/<repo> remote explicitly — workers default to t-fi). Updated mcp-server targets (#308/307/306/304/301/300) after mass merge of 12 PRs today.
- v7.5 → v7.6 (cycle 100): Verify-first pattern for mcp-server issues — always check if tools already exist before implementing (e.g. #308 was already done in #147). Updated mcp-server targets to remaining #304/301/300. tweet.js fix: `--type <template> '<json>'` (no --data flag).
- v7.6 → v7.7 (cycle 110): Updated mcp-server targets — #304/#301/#300 now have open PRs (#328/#329/#330); next target is #190 (ordinals marketplace). Added size-bound note for #336 (quick fix). Added Nostr key derivation shortcut: use `account.nostrPrivateKey` directly (NIP-06, already in wallet-manager). Arc0btc review cadence: ~1-2 hr turnaround on PR feedback.
- v7.7 → v7.8 (cycle 120): PR auto-close fix — use `closes #N` (not `closing #N`) in PR body or GitHub won't auto-close issues. "closing" is not a recognized keyword. Arc0btc blocking pattern: revocation field always false (non-existent struct field), missing submit step in two-step API flows. All open PRs now have CHANGES_REQUESTED — dispatched workers for #328 + #341 fixes in parallel.
- v7.8 → v7.9 (cycle 155): Removed stale #336 quick-fix (CLOSED). Updated #300/#301 note (tools exist in v1.37.0).
- v7.9 → v7.10 (cycle 161): Updated mcp-server targets with ping timing. Removed hardcoded UTC times; track exact times in STATE.md follow-ups.
- v7.10 → v7.11 (cycle 179): Fixed stale hardcoded ping times in mcp-server targets bullet.
- v7.11 → v7.12 (cycle 180): PR saturation check: currently 12 open PRs across 4 repos — within limits. Clarified that ping windows must always track from STATE.md, never hardcode UTC times in loop.md.
